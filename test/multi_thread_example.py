    text = u'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of âˆ¼19-24 ' \
           'nucleotides (nt) in length and considered as potent ' \
           'regulators of gene expression at transcriptional and ' \
           'post-transcriptional levels. Here we report the identification ' \
           'and characterization of 15 conserved miRNAs belonging to 13 ' \
           'families from Rauvolfia serpentina through in silico analysis ' \
           'of available nucleotide dataset. The identified mature R. ' \
           'serpentina miRNAs (rse-miRNAs) ranged between 20 and 22nt in ' \
           'length, and the average minimal folding free energy index (MFEI) ' \
           'value of rse-miRNA precursor sequences was found to be ' \
           '-0.815kcal/mol. Using the identified rse-miRNAs as query, their ' \
           'potential targets were predicted in R. serpentina and other plant ' \
           'species. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation showed that predicted ' \
           'targets of rse-miRNAs include transcription factors as well as ' \
           'genes involved in diverse biological processes such as primary ' \
           'and secondary metabolism, stress response, disease resistance, ' \
           'growth, and development. Few rse-miRNAs were predicted to target ' \
           'genes of pharmaceutically important secondary metabolic pathways ' \
           'such as alkaloids and anthocyanin biosynthesis. Phylogenetic ' \
           'analysis showed the evolutionary relationship of rse-miRNAs and ' \
           'their precursor sequences to homologous pre-miRNA sequences from ' \
           'other plant species. The findings under present study besides giving ' \
           'first hand information about R. serpentina miRNAs and their targets, ' \
           'also contributes towards the better understanding of miRNA-mediated ' \
           'gene regulatory processes in plants.'
